# Poe discord notify

This utility tracks positive economic changes in the Path of Exile (PoE) game using open APIs from poe.ninja and Path of Exile. 

It monitors key economic indicators, such as item prices, currency exchange rates, to identify significant positive shifts. 
When a positive change is detected, the utility automatically posts updates in a specified Discord channel.
